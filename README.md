# Overview

This is an app that I decided to build to test what I can do using Javascript in React-Native and Expo Go.

This app will detect Facial features location and distance from the camera. It will do this using Google Mobile Vision API.

I created this app to see how far I could go in app development. I decided to add a backend in my next project so this one will test how far the frontend can carry an app without internet connection.

# Development Environment

I used React Native running in Expo Go to test my app and create flexibility to publish on Android and Apple. React-Native is a Framework very similar to React, using Javascript it can creat reactive and scalable applications for mobile and web.

I programmed almost all of this useing Javascript and JSX files.
